# LeetCode-Style Coding Platform | MERN Stack

- **Implemented** a full-stack coding practice platform inspired by LeetCode, featuring real-time code execution powered by the Judge0 API.  
- **Improved** the interactive coding environment using the Monaco Editor by utilizing syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and live error detection to deliver a better developer experience.  
- **Employed** secure authentication mechanisms using JWT, bcrypt, and Redis session caching, ensuring fast login while preventing token misuse.  
- **Established** a role-based access system enabling admins to add, update, and delete coding problems, while users solve, submit, and track progress in real time.  
- **Generated** problem-solving analytics that allow users to view solved problems, submission status, and coding history with persistent storage in MongoDB.  
- **Fine-tuned** backend performance and reliability by implementing rate limiting, API validation, and a secure middleware architecture.
